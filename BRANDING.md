## 🎬 Animation System

### Circuit Board Styles

**Standard Styles** (Static patterns with basic animations):
- `subtle` - Light traces, minimal distraction
- `moderate` - Visible circuits, balanced presence (default)
- `bold` - Dense network, high visual impact

**Randomized Styles** (Organic, non-repetitive animations):
- `bold-random` - Randomized circuit board with multi-color nodes
- `pcb-animated` - Full PCB motherboard with animated buses and data flow particles

### Animation Features

The randomized animation system includes:
- **Multi-color gradients**: Sage, blue, and purple color scheme
- **Data flow particles**: Visual representation of data transfer
- **Randomized timing**: Every element has unique animation parameters
- **Better bus definition**: 5px thick lines for visibility
- **Organic motion**: Non-repetitive, natural feeling animations

### Usage in PageSkeleton

```tsx
<PageSkeleton circuitStyle="pcb-animated" codeRain={true}>
  {/* Your content */}
</PageSkeleton>
```

### Documentation

For complete animation documentation, see:
- [RANDOMIZED-ANIMATIONS.md](RANDOMIZED-ANIMATIONS.md) - Full randomized animation system guide
- [SCROLLING-ANIMATIONS.md](SCROLLING-ANIMATIONS.md) - Scroll-based animation system
